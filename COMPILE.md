# Compile

The principle of compilability reaches further than 'open source'. Any software tester is able to compile the open source software just as efficient as the developer(s).
All third-party software meets the following:
No software created after April 26th 2020 Sunday 12:45h UTC will be used, except this repository.
Dependencies will be defined by version and downloadable or included in this repository.

## Upgrade or downgrade to the following software versions

MacOS 10.15.4 Supplemental Update 19E287 April 8, 2020 (clean install)

Xcode 11.4.1 11E503a April 15, 2020

Command Line Tools for Xcode 11.4.1 April 15, 2020
