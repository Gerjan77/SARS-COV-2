# Compile

The principle of compilability reaches further than 'open source'. Any software tester is able to compile the open source software just as efficient as the developer(s).
As a matter of principle, all third-party software meets the following:
No software created after April 26th 2020 Sunday 12:45h UTC will be used, except this repository.
Dependencies will be exactly defined by version and downloadable or included in this repository.
The compiling platform is fully defined by the dependency version list.

## Upgrade or downgrade to the following software versions
